* This is a fork of [[https://github.com/lewang/fic-mode][fic-mode]]

* How to use it?
  Just add it to load path in your ~/.emacs.d/init.el after downloading or cloning it.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/mark-mode")
#+END_SRC
  Then put the words you want to highlight.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq mark-target-keywords '("the" "words" "to" "highlight")
#+END_SRC
or add new words instead of replacing
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'mark-target-keywords '("the" "words" "to" "highlight")
#+END_SRC

* There are something missing
  - JUMP-TO functionality (coming soon)
